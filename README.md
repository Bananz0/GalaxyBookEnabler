# GalaxyBookEnabler
This script enables some of the features limited to Galaxy Books such as Quick Share, Multi Control and Samsung Notes

To my knowledge, QuickShare only works if you have Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards so your mileage may vary. This only works after running the script. I will look for a method to add it to the task scheduler and have it run as admin at startup.

Make sure to have these installed:

[Samsung Account](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P98T77876KZ?hl=en-us&gl=US)
[Samsung Continuity Serivce](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/samsung-continuity-service/9NGW9K44GQ5F?hl=en-GB&gl=US)
[Samsung Cloud Assistant](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NFWHCHM52HQ?hl=en-us&gl=US)

[Quick Share (Optional)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PCTGDFXVZLJ?hl=en-us&gl=US)
[Samsung Notes (Optional)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NBLGGH43VHV?query=samsung+note&hl=en-us&gl=US)
[Multi Control (Optional)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/samsung-multi-control/9N3L4FZ03Q99?hl=en-us&gl=US)

To download these apps, you could use the store or [this](https://store.rg-adguard.net/) which downloads the actual exectuable installer which could be used as a backup.

I am not responsible for bricked devices, what you do with this information is your responsibility not mine.

This can be fixed by Samsung at any time and can stop working completely, keep that in mind.

Credits to @obrobrio2000 for the initial script as this is a slightly modified version of it.
