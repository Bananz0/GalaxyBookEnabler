# GalaxyBookEnabler

## Introduction

The GalaxyBookEnabler script is designed to enable some features that are typically limited to Galaxy Books, including Quick Share, Multi Control, and Samsung Notes.

Please read this readme carefully to understand the script's purpose and usage. Note that Quick Share functionality may depend on your Wi-Fi card, and results may vary.

## Installation

To install the script, follow these steps:

1. Run the GalaxyBookEnabler script as an administrator in PowerShell.

The script automates the installation process, making your laptop appear as a Galaxy Book, which is necessary as this spoof resets every boot.

## System Requirements

Before using the script, ensure you have the following software packages installed:

- [Samsung Account](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P98T77876KZ?hl=en-us&gl=US)
- [Samsung Continuity Service](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/samsung-continuity-service/9NGW9K44GQ5F?hl=en-GB&gl=US)
- [Samsung Cloud Assistant](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NFWHCHM52HQ?hl=en-us&gl=US)

For optional features, you can install:

- [Quick Share (Optional)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PCTGDFXVZLJ?hl=en-us&gl=US)
- [Samsung Notes (Optional)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NBLGGH43VHV?query=samsung+note&hl=en-us&gl=US)
- [Multi Control (Optional)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/samsung-multi-control/9N3L4FZ03Q99?hl=en-us&gl=US)

You can download these apps from the Microsoft Store or use [this alternative source](https://store.rg-adguard.net/) to get the executable installer as a backup.

## Important Notes

- The script installs a batch file into the User folder, which runs automatically on startup to enable the Galaxy Book features.
- The script is necessary because the spoof resets every time the system reboots.
